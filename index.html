            <h3>Aeorobic  Workout</h3>
            <p>Aerobic exercise is any type of cardiovascular conditioning, or “cardio.” It can include activities like brisk walking, swimming, running, or cycling. By definition,
                 aerobic exercise means “with oxygen.” Your breathing and heart rate will increase during aerobic activities.</p>

            <h3>Resistance  Workout</h3>
            <p>Resistance training increases muscle strength by making your muscles work against a weight or force. Different forms of resistance training include using free weights,
                 weight machines, resistance bands and your own body weight. A beginner needs to train two or three times per week to gain the maximum benefit.</p>

            <h3>Stretching  Workout</h3>
            <p>Stretching is a form of physical exercise in which a specific muscle or tendon (or muscle group) is deliberately flexed or stretched in order to improve the muscle's felt 
                elasticity and achieve comfortable muscle tone. The result is a feeling of increased muscle control, flexibility, and range of motion.</p>
